# Medical Text Generation with Fine-Tuned LLaMA-2 Model

This repository contains the project for fine-tuning and evaluating a large language model on a medical dataset using AWS SageMaker. The focus is on customizing the LLaMA-2 7B model to generate domain-specific medical text.

## Project Overview

- **Model Fine-Tuning**: The LLaMA-2 model is fine-tuned using a medical dataset stored in an S3 bucket. This process adapts the model's pre-trained weights to better understand and generate text relevant to medical contexts.
  
- **Model Deployment**: After fine-tuning, the model is deployed as an endpoint on SageMaker. This allows for real-time inference, where the model generates text based on given medical prompts.

- **Model Evaluation**: The deployed model is tested with specific prompts to evaluate its ability to generate coherent and relevant medical text. The results are reviewed to assess the model's performance and suitability for practical applications.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to SageMaker.
- An S3 bucket to store datasets and model artifacts.
- Basic knowledge of AWS SageMaker and Python.

## How to Use

1. **Fine-Tuning**: Start by fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 model using your medical dataset. This step customizes the model's behavior to produce more relevant outputs in the medical domain.

2. **Model Deployment**: Once fine-tuned, deploy the model to an AWS SageMaker endpoint. This allows you to use the model for generating text based on specific medical prompts.

3. **Model Evaluation**: After deployment, the model can be tested with various inputs to evaluate its performance. The results can be used to further refine the model or to proceed with its application in real-world scenarios.

4. **Resource Management**: Remember to delete the SageMaker endpoint and any associated resources once you are done, to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

## Model Artifacts

- The model weights and configuration files are stored in the specified S3 bucket following the completion of the fine-tuning process.
- These artifacts are crucial for deploying the model and should be securely stored for future use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning and deploying a large language model for generating specialized text in the medical field. By leveraging AWS SageMaker, the model can be customized and evaluated efficiently, providing a powerful tool for various medical applications.
